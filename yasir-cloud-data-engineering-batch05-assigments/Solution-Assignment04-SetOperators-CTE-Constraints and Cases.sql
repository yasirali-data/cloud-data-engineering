-- Q7.
-- The business wants to launch a customer loyalty program.
-- Below is the table structure. Your job is to add the correct constraints:
--   - Each card must have a unique card number (not auto-generated).
--   - The card must be linked to a valid customer in sales.customers.
--   - Points balance cannot be negative.
--   - Tier must be one of: 'Bronze', 'Silver', or 'Gold'.
--   - Join date is required and cannot be empty.
--   - If a customer is deleted, their loyalty card record should also be deleted.
--
-- Starter table (add your constraints here):
--
-- CREATE TABLE sales.loyalty_cards (
--     card_number   INT,
--     customer_id   INT,
--     points        INT,
--     tier          VARCHAR(10),
--     join_date     DATE
-- );
--
-- Once the table is created, run these inserts to verify your constraints work:
--
-- INSERT INTO sales.loyalty_cards VALUES (1001, 1,  500,  'Gold',   '2024-01-15');
-- INSERT INTO sales.loyalty_cards VALUES (1002, 2,  150,  'Silver', '2024-03-22');
-- INSERT INTO sales.loyalty_cards VALUES (1003, 3,  0,    'Bronze', '2024-06-01');
--
-- Also try these to confirm your constraints REJECT bad data:
-- INSERT INTO sales.loyalty_cards VALUES (1001, 4,  100,  'Gold',   '2024-07-01'); -- duplicate card_number
-- INSERT INTO sales.loyalty_cards VALUES (1004, 1,  -50,  'Silver', '2024-08-01'); -- negative points

-- Q8.
-- The operations team realized that some orders in the database have
-- a shipped_date that is earlier than the order_date, which is impossible.
-- Add a rule to the table below that prevents this from happening.
-- Then try inserting a valid row and an invalid row to confirm it works.
--
-- Run this setup first:
--
-- CREATE TABLE test_orders (
--     order_id      INT PRIMARY KEY,
--     order_date    DATE NOT NULL,
--     shipped_date  DATE
-- );

-- INSERT INTO test_orders VALUES (2, '2024-02-05', '2024-02-07');
-- INSERT INTO test_orders VALUES (3, '2024-03-01', NULL);
--
-- Now add the constraint using ALTER TABLE (do not recreate the table).
-- After adding it, test with:
-- INSERT INTO test_orders VALUES (4, '2024-04-10', '2024-04-08'); -- should FAIL
-- INSERT INTO test_orders VALUES (5, '2024-04-10', '2024-04-15'); -- should PASS

--   - 'Sufficient'    — quantity between 11 and 50
--   - 'Well Stocked'  — quantity above 50
-- Show store_id, product_id, quantity, and stock_status.
-- Sort by store_id, then quantity ascending.
