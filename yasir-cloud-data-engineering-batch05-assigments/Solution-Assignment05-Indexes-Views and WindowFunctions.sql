-- ============================================================
--  SECTION A — INDEXES
-- ============================================================

-- Q1.
-- The marketing team frequently runs campaigns filtered by brand.
-- They search products like this:
--
--   SELECT product_id, product_name, list_price
--   FROM production.products
--   WHERE brand_id = 3;
--
-- This query is slow. Create an appropriate index to fix it.
-- Then run the query to confirm it returns results correctly.

-- Non-Clustered Index
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_products_brand_id
ON production.products (brand_id);

-- Test Query
SELECT product_id, product_name, list_price
FROM production.products
WHERE brand_id = 3;

-- Q2.
-- The finance team runs a monthly report that filters orders
-- by a date range, for example:
--
--   SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date
--   FROM sales.orders
--   WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-30';
--
-- Create an index to make this query more efficient.

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_orders_order_date
ON sales.orders (order_date);

-- Test Query
SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date
FROM sales.orders
WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-30';

-- ============================================================
--  SECTION B — VIEWS
-- ============================================================

-- Q3.
-- The customer support team needs a daily list of all
-- pending and processing orders so they can follow up.
-- Create a view that shows:
--   order_id, customer full name, phone, email,
--   order_date, and order status as a readable label
--   (not a number — use 1=Pending, 2=Processing).
-- After creating it, query the view to see today's workload.

CREATE VIEW vw_pending_processing_orders

JOIN sales.customers c
    ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE o.order_status IN (1,2);
GO

--View th query
SELECT *
FROM vw_pending_processing_orders;



-- Q4.
-- The inventory manager wants a single view to monitor stock
-- across all stores without writing complex joins every time.
-- Create a view that shows:
--   store_name, product_name, brand_name, category_name, quantity
-- After creating it, query the view to find all products
-- that have fewer than 3 units remaining in any store.

CREATE VIEW vw_inventory_stock
AS
SELECT
    s.store_name,
    p.product_name,
    b.brand_name,
